statistics are a fundamental tools for a data analysis.\nTheir purpose is to describe and summarize data.\nQuantitative variables such as weight, age, and income can be described by distributions (e.g., normal distribution) with measures of **center** (the typical value of a variable) and **variability** (spread around the center).\nThe mean is a measure of center.\nThe standard deviation is a measure of variability.\n\nThere are special descriptive statistics that help us describe simultaneously center and spread of a variable's distribution.\nThese measures are often known as measures of **positions**.\nIn general, they tell us the point of the distribution of a variable at which a given percentage of the data falls below or above that point.\nThe minimum and maximum values of a variable are measures of positions defining the point at which no data, or all data, fall below it, respectively.\nThe median is a measure of position that defines the point at which half of the data falls below it (and above it).\nThe median is a special case of the measure of position called **percentile**.\nThe p-th percentile is the point such that p\\% of the observations fall below or at that point and (100 - p)% fall above it.\nThe 50-th percentile is the median.\n\n**Quartiles** are commonly used percentiles.\nThe first quartile is the 25-th percentile, the value of the variable leaving to its left 25% of the distribution.\nThe third quartile is the 75-th percentile, the value of the variable leaving to its left 75% of the distribution.\nYou can think of quartiles as diving the probability distribution in 4 intervals with equal probabilities (e.g., area under the probability density function).\nSimilarly, you can think of percentiles as diving the probability
