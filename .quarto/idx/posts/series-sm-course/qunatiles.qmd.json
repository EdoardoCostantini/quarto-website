p)% fall above it.\nThe 50-th percentile is the median.\n\n**Quartiles** are commonly used percentiles.\nThe first quartile is the 25-th percentile, the value of the variable leaving to its left 25% of the distribution.\nThe third quartile is the 75-th percentile, the value of the variable leaving to its left 75% of the distribution.\nYou can think of quartiles as diving the probability distribution in 4 intervals with equal probabilities (e.g., area under the probability density function).\nSimilarly, you can think of percentiles as diving the probability distribution in 100 intervals with equal probabilities.\n\n```{r quartile-pic, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height = 8}\n\n# Set a seed\n\nset.seed(20220906)\n\n# Sample from a normal distribution\n\nage <- rnorm(1e5, mean = 27, sd = 2)\n\n# Define the 1st and 2nd quartile\n\nquartiles <- quantile(age, probs = c(.25, .75))\n\n# Plot density distribution\n\nplot(density(age),\n     main = \"Quartiles for the probability distribution of age\",\n     xlab = NA)\n\n# Costum x ticks\naxis(side = 1, at = c(27, round(quartiles, 1)), labels = TRUE)\n\n# Add points for quantiles\npoints(c(quartiles, median(age)),\n        y = rep(0, length(quartiles)+1))\npoints(c(quartiles, median(age)),\n       y = dnorm(c(quartiles, median(age)), mean = mean(age), sd = sd(age)))\n\n# Add segments to devide plot\nsegments(x0 = quartiles[1], y0 = 0,\n         x1 = quartiles[1], y1 = dnorm(quartiles[1],\n                                       mean = mean(age), sd = sd(age)))\nsegments(x0 = median(age), y0 = 0,\n         x1 = median(age), y1 = max(dnorm(age,\n                                       mean = mean(age), sd = sd(age))))\nsegments(x0 = quartiles[2], y0 = 0,\n         x1 = quartiles[2], y1 = dnorm(quartiles[2],\n                                       mean = mean(age), sd = sd(age)))\n\n# Add quartile labels\ntext(x = quartiles[1],\n     y = -.005,\n     \"1st quartile\")\ntext(x = quartiles[2],\n     y = -.005,\n     \"3rd quartile\")\n\n# Add percentage under the curve labels\ntext(x = c(24, 30, 26.3, 27.7),\n     y = c(.03, .03, .06, .06),\n     \"25 %\")\n\n```\n\n\nWe use the word **quantile** to describe the general measure of position that divides the probability distribution in intervals with equal probabilities.\nPercentiles divide the probability distribution of a variable in 100 intervals.\nDeciles divide it in 10 intervals, and quartiles in four.\nAs such, percentiles, deciles, quartiles, and the median are all special cases of quantiles.\n\n# TL;DR, just give me the code!\n```{r TLDR, ref.label = knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}\n```"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"qunatiles.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":"custom.scss","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Understanding quantiles","author":"Edoardo Costantini","date":"2022-09-06","slug":"quantiles","categories":["Statistics","Distributions"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
